# Binary_1_counter_circuit
OVERVIEW OF PROJECT:

The main theme of our Mini Project is to design and implement  circuit for counting number of One’s in given binary input. We make of simple for looping construct, wherein we iterate and go  through each and every bit of 8 bit binary input given and examine the presence of One’s. We also initialise a counter element (initially to  Zero), which keep the count of One’s in the given when iterated. As on the Control finds the presence of One, counter element is incremented. 8 Sample testcases as been taken and number of One’s are counted. Henceforth the binary input and Number of One’s are represented in GTKWave window in the form of Waveforms. Upon compiling the circuit logic and testbench logic, output waveform is recorded in a VCD file and Output is displayed in GTKWave window.
Let say binary input is 7

In binary it is -> 00000111
Number of Ones-> 3
